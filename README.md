# Hi there! I'm Romeo

## About Me
I'm a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at the Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology, passionate about low-level programming, AI, and embedded systems. I have experience in software development, system design, and real-time applications. I love tackling complex problems and building innovative solutions that blend AI, IoT, and real-time computing.

## Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: C, C++, Python, SystemVerilog, x86 Assembly
- AI & Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe
- Embedded Systems: ESP32 (project is underway), IoT, real-time systems
- OS & Low-Level Development: x86 Assembly,multithreading
- Web & Backend: JavaScript, Chrome Extensions
- Mathematical & Signal Processing Tools: MATLAB, Simulink
- Development Tools: VMWare, Git, Linux

## Current Projects
### AI-Powered Stroke Rehabilitation
- Developing a hand-tracking AI system with real-time feedback for rehabilitation exercises.
- Uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, Python, and AI for gesture recognition and movement analysis.
- Implements gamification and cloud integration for remote monitoring.

### Smart Mic Chrome Extension
- AI-powered background noise suppression and voice detection.
- Uses a Chrome extension and Python server to intelligently mute/unmute audio based on detected speech.

### AI-Powered Voice Assistant
- A real-time voice assistant that processes commands and executes actions.
- Uses speech recognition and AI for seamless interaction.

### IoT Face Detection System
- An ESP32-based security system that unlocks a device upon face recognition.
- Uses a Python-based external camera to send HTTP requests for authentication.
- Stores and processes face encodings in a local database.
